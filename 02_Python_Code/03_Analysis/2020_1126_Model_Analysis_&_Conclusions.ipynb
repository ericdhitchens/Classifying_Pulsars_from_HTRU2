    "The challenge of the dataset is to find the best model that correctly identifies the most pulsars. The pulsars comprise approximately only 10% of the dataset, so accuracy is not an appropriate statistic to use when comparing models. Since we want to be as confident as possible that the instances classified as pulsars actually *are* pulsars, our most important metric is recall.\n",

The random forest model tied with the DNN model in terms of F1-score (to 2 significant figures), but it had a lower recall of 0.84 and higher precision of 0.94. Both models should be considered for future testing, and additional testing of the DNN should be run to further optimize its architecture."
